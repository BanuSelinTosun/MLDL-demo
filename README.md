# MLDL-demo
Introduction

The goal of this exercise is to create a demo on IBM Power systems with the following ingredients:
1) CfC as container orchestrator
2) An Nvidia docker container managed  by CfC
3) a Jupyter notebook exercising TensorFlow using GPU inside the Nvidia container

Note: for building the environment, we use a Minsky system (2 sockets, 4 GPUs)

CfC Installation

The CfC installation is documented at: https://github.com/fbarilla/CfC
